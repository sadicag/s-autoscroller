A windows-like autoscroller for Linux based systems.

The program can be installed by running the `install.sh` in the terminal.

Certain parameters can be configured for your personal use in the `config.ini` file.

Everytime the cursor is moved, it recalculates the speed of the scrolling which pauses the current scrolling activity, so there might be a little delay.

Potentially for the future, a rightclick to the window could open up a menu to customize the configuration of the program.
